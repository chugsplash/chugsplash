# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide covers some common issues you might encounter using Sphinx. If your question isn't answered here, please reach out in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/7Gc3DK33Np).

## General

### `Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit allocation failed` error
This bug can occur in repositories that have a very large number of contracts in them. This causes your build info artifact files to be extremely large, which can cause memory issues when using Sphinx. You can resolve this issue by running `forge clean`, which clears the artifacts directory, including the build info files.

## Sphinx client

### The `sphinx generate` CLI task results in a compilation failure related to the Sphinx client
The `sphinx generate` command automatically skips compiling any script and test files to avoid compilation failures like this. If you do encounter this, it is likely because you have a Foundry script or test file that imports clients but does not use the standard `.s.sol` or `.t.sol` suffixes. You should check that all of your test and script files are using the proper suffix.

### Cannot find the autogenerated deployment function for a contract
If your repository contains more than one contract with the same name, we resolve this ambiguity by using the fully qualified name as the function name.

For example, say you have two contracts called `MyContract`, where one is located at `path/to/File.sol` and the other is located at `other/path/to/File.sol`. The deployment function for the first contract would be:

```
function deployPathToFile_MyContract(...) external returns (...)
```

The deployment function for the second contract would be:
```
function deployOtherPathToFile_MyContract(...) external returns (...)
```
