## npx sphinx generate yields compilation failures related to autogenerated Sphinx clients
The `sphinx generate` command automatically skips compiling any script and test files to avoid compilation failures like this. If you do encounter this, it is likely due to you having a script or test file that imports clients but does not use the standard .s.sol or .t.sol suffixes. You should check that all of your test and script files are using the proper suffix.

## 'Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit allocation failed' error
This bug can sometimes occur in projects that have a very large number of contracts in them often due to the use of a large number of dependencies. This leads to your `buildinfo` files being extremely large which can cause memory issues when using Sphinx. You can resolve this issue by running `forge clean`, however if you encouter this issue presistently please report it to the developers as it should not happen.

## 'No bytecode for contract. Is it abstract or unlinked?' error
This error occurs because you are using a contract that requires an externally linked library. Externally linked libraries are not currently supported by Sphinx. If you can, you should switch to using an internal library instead. If this is a blocking issue for you, please let us know. We have not added support for externally linked libraries yet as they are relatively uncommon.

## Cannot find the deployment function for my contract in SphinxClient
This can occasionally happen if you have multiple contracts with the same name because we have to generate a unique deployment function name for each contract. In these cases, we use the fully qualified path for the deployment function name.

For example, if I had a contract with the fully qualified path:
`path/to/File.sol:MyContract`

Then he deploy function would be:
`deployPathToFile_MyContract`
