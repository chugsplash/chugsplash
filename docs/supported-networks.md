# Supported Networks
Sphinx is deployed on and officially supports 11 networks and their associated test networks. We've listed those networks below along with their Network enum values which you may use to specify them as target networks in your Sphinx scripts. While we currently only support these networks, Sphinx is able to support most EVM compatible networks. So if you're looking to deploy on a network that isn't listed yet, please let us know in the Discord or open a GitHub Issue.

TODO(md): these don't seem to be generating a table correctly.

TODO(md): maybe this should be included in the main readme's reference guides?
