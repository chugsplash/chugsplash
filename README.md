# Sphinx (formerly ChugSplash)

Sphinx is a Foundry plugin for deployments.

TODO(md): it takes 9.5s to compile the sample project every time a change is made to a file. it
takes less than 2s when the optimizer is off. we should definitely tell users to turn optimizer off
during testing and development. i think there's a section in the foundry docs that covers this.

TODO(init): `contracts/` -> `src/`

Key features:
* Skips any transactions in your script that have already been executed, similar to other idempotent tools like [`hardhat-deploy`](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy).
* Provides visibility into your deployments by letting you [preview](TODO(md)) the transactions that will be executed in your script.
* Uses `CREATE3` by default, so your contracts will always have predictable addresses.
* Generates deployments artifacts in the same format as [`hardhat-deploy`](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy).

## DevOps Platform (optional)

Sphinx has a DevOps platform that automates the deployment process. It's built on top of the Foundry plugin, and is entirely opt-in.

Key features:
* Propose your deployments from a CI process.
* Maintain a balance of USDC on a single chain to fund deployments. You don't need native gas tokens on any chain.
* Approve your deployments via a multisig.
* Automatic Etherscan verification.

You can request access to the DevOps platform [here](https://sphinx.dev).
