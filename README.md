# Sphinx (formerly ChugSplash)
Sphinx is a Foundry plugin for writing transparent, predictable, and multi-chain deployment scripts. Sphinx has an opt-in DevOps platform that automates the deployment process with features such as gasless deployments in CI and multichain deployments.

Key features:
* **Deployment preview**: Sphinx provides visibility into your deployments by generating a [preview](TODO(md): screenshot) before any transactions are executed.
* **Create3**: Sphinx deploys your contracts to predictable addresses using `CREATE3`.
* **Multi-chain**: Sphinx makes it easy to write chain-specific logic and replicate these configurations locally.

## Sphinx DevOps Platform
The Sphinx DevOps Platform is built on top of the Foundry plugin, and is entirely opt-in.

Key features:
* Propose your deployments gaslessly from a CI process or your local machine, approve deployments via the Sphinx UI with a single meta transaction, and have your deployment executed by the Sphinx Platform across up to 11 different networks.
* Maintain a balance of USDC on a single chain to fund deployments across all chains. You don't need native gas tokens on any chain.
* Automatic Etherscan verification.

> Sphinx is in active development and uses smart contracts which are not yet audited. You should **always** verify your contracts were deployed and configured properly after deploying with Sphinx.
