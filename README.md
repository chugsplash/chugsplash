# Sphinx (formerly ChugSplash)

Sphinx is a DevOps platform for multi-chain smart contract deployments.

Request access [here](https://sphinx.dev).

## Key Features

Sphinx can either be used as a standalone CLI tool for deployments on a single chain, or as a DevOps platform that extends the CLI tool with additional functionality, such as one-click multi-chain deployments and automatic Etherscan verification.

### Standalone CLI
- Define deployments in a declarative config file instead of writing deployment scripts
- Consistent addresses across networks via `CREATE3`
- Deployment artifacts in the same format as [`hardhat-deploy`](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy)
- Available as a Foundry and Hardhat plugin

### DevOps Platform
- Approve multi-chain deployments with a single meta transaction
- Maintain a balance of USDC on a single chain to fund deployments
- Propose deployments from your CI process gaslessly
- Automatic Etherscan verification
- Support for multisigs (coming soon)
