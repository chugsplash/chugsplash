# Sphinx (formerly ChugSplash)

Sphinx is a DevOps platform for smart contract deployments.

## Key Features

Sphinx can either be used as a standalone CLI tool for simple deployments, or as a DevOps platform that extends the CLI tool with additional functionality.

### Standalone CLI
- Define deployments in a declarative config file instead of writing deployment scripts
- Consistent addresses across networks via `CREATE3`
- Deployment artifacts in the same format as [`hardhat-deploy`](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy)
- Available as a Foundry and Hardhat plugin

### DevOps Platform
- Approve multi-chain deployments with a single meta transaction
- Maintain a balance of USDC on a single chain to fund deployments
- Automatic Etherscan verification
- Support for multisigs (coming soon)
