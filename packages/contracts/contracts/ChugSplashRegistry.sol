 *         contract allows callers to register new ChugSplashManagers. Also, every event emitted in
           the
 *         ChugSplash system is announced through this contract. This makes it easy for clients to
 *         find and index events that occur throughout the deployment process. Lastly, the owner of
 *         this contract is able to add support for new contract kinds (e.g. OpenZeppelin's
           Transparent proxy). The owner can also new versions of the ChugSplashManager
 *         implementation.
