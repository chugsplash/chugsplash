/**
 * @title ProxyUpdater
 * @notice An abstract contract that contains the logic which sets storage slots within the proxy
 *         contract when an action is executed in the ChugSplashManager. When execution is being
 *         initiated, the ChugSplashManager sets each proxy to have a ProxyUpdater as its
 *         implementation. Then, during execution, the ChugSplashManager triggers `setStorage`
 *         actions on the proxy by calling the proxy, which then delegatecalls into a ProxyUpdater
 *         contract.

abstract contract ProxyUpdater is IProxyUpdater {
    /**
     * @notice Replaces a segment of a proxy's storage slot value at a given key and offset. The
     *         storage value outside of this segment remains the same. Note that it's crucial for
     *         this function not to revert under any circumstances because this would halt the
     *         entire execution process. This means overflow checks must occur off-chain before
     *         execution begins.
     *
     *         To illustrate how this function works, consider the following example. Say we call
     *         this function on some storage slot key with the input parameters:
     *         `_offset = 2`
     *         `_value = 0x22222222`
     *
     *         Say the storage slot value prior to calling this function is:
     *         0xCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
     *
     *         This function works by creating a bit mask at the location of the segment, which in
     *         this case is at an `offset` of 2 and is 4 bytes long (extending left from the
     *         offset). The bit mask would be:
     *         0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF00000000FFFF
     *
     *         Applying this bit mask to the existing slot value, we get:
     *         0xCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC00000000CCCC
     *
     *         Then, we offset the new segment to the correct location in the storage slot:
     *         0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000222222220000
     *
     *         Lastly, add these two values together to get the new storage slot value:
     *         0xCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC22222222CCCC
     *
     * @param _key     Storage key to modify.
     * @param _offset  Bytes offset of the new segment from the right side of the storage slot.
     * @param _segment New value for the segment of the storage slot. The length of this value is a
     *                 bytesN value, where N is in the range [1, 32] (inclusive).
